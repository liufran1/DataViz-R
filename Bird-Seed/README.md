Submission for `r/dataisbeautiful`'s July 2018 [DataViz Battle](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/8vhxhq/battle_dataviz_battle_for_the_month_of_july_2018/), a visualization of the feeding habits of 15 bird species.

7/5/18 Update: [u/DrDalmaijer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/8vr4rv/grouping_birds_by_their_feeding_preferences_using/) executed pretty well my original concept, using ICA instead of PCA. Was able to recreate their clusters using the `fastICA` package in R. 

Currently brainstorming alternative concepts.
