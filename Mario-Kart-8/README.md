Inspired by [Civis Analytics' analysis of Mario Kart 8](https://medium.com/civis-analytics/the-best-mario-kart-character-according-to-data-science-7dfb65d4c18e) optimal setups based on Pareto Frontier of stats, I wanted to compare actual usage by the best (i.e. "rational") players to the theoretical. 

For those players' choices, we can see what the world record times are set using, found [here](https://mkwrs.com/mk8/). However, turns out it's not that interesting because players very quickly converged to the "Wario-Gold Standard-Slick" setup, which has the highest top speed. Instead, we'll take a look at how times and strategies evolved over time.
